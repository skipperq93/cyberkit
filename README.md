## Building from Source
If building yourself, you may wish to use the version of Xcode used at the time to build the commit you are building.

On branches diverging before 1 May 2024 (that is, before `safari-7619.1.12-branch`, see WebKit#27941), you must run `Tools/Scripts/configure-xcode-for-embedded-development` before 1st build or any time you reinstall/update Xcode or its SDKs.

Beginning 2 January 2024, you can just [ad hoc sign](https://akemi.ai/?page/how2asu) with no changes to CyberKit itself which is especially convenient if you want to build in a macOS VM on Apple Silicon [where you can't sign in to your Apple ID](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/707682).

You will build the "Everything up to CyberKit" target then the appropriate app.

### Development Environment Notes

* Development is performed on macOS using Xcode.
* The rename script requires `gnu-sed` and `rename`, which can be obtained using Homebrew.
* Beginning with [fa2170c](https://github.com/UInt2048/CyberKit/commit/fa2170c3604b4ccacbc4f2475f91c0638ac7a2a0) [7 April 2023], Xcode 14.3 is used.
* Before this, Xcode 14.2 was used.
